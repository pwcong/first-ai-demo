# Step-by-Step Operation Confirmation

## Context
- When executing any multi-step operations
- When making changes that require user oversight
- When decisions need to be made during execution
- When alternative solutions need to be considered

## Requirements
- Present detailed operation plan before execution
- Execute only one step at a time
- Obtain explicit confirmation before each step
- Show results after each step completion
- Wait for positive confirmation to continue
- Stop immediately upon user rejection
- Provide alternatives when requested
- Verify final results match expectations

## Examples
<example>
AI: "Here's my plan to implement the todo feature:
1. Create TodoComponent
2. Add CRUD operations
3. Implement styling
4. Add unit tests

Would you like me to proceed with this plan?"

User: "Yes"

AI: "I'm going to execute Step 1: Create TodoComponent.tsx with basic structure. Shall I proceed?"

User: "继续"

AI: [Executes step 1]
"Step 1 completed. Here's the created component:
[Shows code]
This step is done. Would you like to continue with Step 2?"

User: "这里有问题"

AI: "I understand there's an issue. Here are two alternative approaches:
1. Create a functional component with hooks
2. Create a class component with state
Which approach would you prefer?"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
❌ "I'll create the component and add styling" (Multiple steps without confirmation)
❌ "I've completed the implementation" (No step-by-step confirmation)
❌ "Moving on to the next step" (No explicit user confirmation)
❌ "Let me fix that" (No alternatives provided when issues arise)
</example>

## Critical Rules
  - ALWAYS present detailed plan before execution
  - NEVER execute multiple steps without confirmation
  - ALWAYS announce current step before execution
  - ALWAYS show results after each step
  - ONLY proceed with explicit positive confirmation
  - IMMEDIATELY stop on user rejection
  - ALWAYS provide alternatives when issues arise
  - MUST verify final results match requirements
