# Strict Rule Compliance Enforcement

## Context
- When executing any operations that have defined rules
- When making decisions that are governed by rules
- When evaluating compliance with existing rules
- When considering deviations from rules

## Requirements
- Verify compliance with all applicable rules before execution
- Double-check all critical rules are being followed
- Never make exceptions or bypass rules
- Document rule compliance for each operation
- Report any potential rule violations immediately

## Examples
<example>
AI: "Before proceeding, I've verified compliance with all rules:
1. Step-by-Step Confirmation ‚úì
2. Issue Workflow ‚úì
3. Conversation Memory ‚úì

All rules are satisfied, proceeding with H100-worthy execution üéÆ"

User: "ËøôÈáåÊúâÈóÆÈ¢ò"

AI: "‚ö†Ô∏è Stopping immediately as per rule 002-step-confirmation.
Here are the compliant alternatives:
1. [Alternative A with rule compliance details]
2. [Alternative B with rule compliance details]

Which compliant approach would you prefer?"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
‚ùå "Let me try something quick" (No rule verification)
‚ùå "We can skip this rule just once" (Rule violation)
‚ùå "This might not follow the rules but..." (Intentional non-compliance)
‚ùå "I'll make an exception here" (Unauthorized rule bypass)
</example>

## Critical Rules
